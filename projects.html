      <h1>Donovan's Projects</h1>
      <p>Games, Apps, etc that I want to showcase. None of these projects are completely finished and polished unless stated so.</p>
      <h2>Purge of the Undead</h2>
      <p>POTU is a game where you are stranded in a remote island and have to survive waves of zombies coming your way. This game was released in July 2020 and is my first game developed in Unity. It is mostly polished and finished but it is missing a lot of potential features to improve gameplay. Some notable aspects of the game are the animation, 3D game design, pleasant terrain, and more.</P>

      <h2>I Gotta Escape</h2>
      <p>IGE is a 2D Platformer where you try to get as far from the ground as possible. This game was released in July 2021 and is my second game developed in Unity. It is not close to a finished game by any means, however I am proud of the infinite platform generation code, player preferences, etc.</P>
